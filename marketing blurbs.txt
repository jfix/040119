Babies in Boxes

With the Marie Kondo-induced tidying craze in full swing, people all over the world folding clothes and cleaning out their garages, one category has been glaringly absent: How do you store your offspring in an efficient manner, with easy access and minimum use of that scarce storage space?

OECD researchers have looked at this question, with their well-known eye for detail and have published the Working Paper “Babies in Boxes” that provides several evidence-based solutions for optimal storage.  Find out more.

La folie du rangement est en plein essor dans le monde entier: avec Marie Kondo, nous plions nos vêtements et rangeons nos garages, mais il y a une catégorie qui n'a clairement pas été traitée: Comment ranger nos enfants de façon efficace, qu'ils restent accessibles mais n'occupent que l'espace minimal dans nos intérieurs saturés ?
Des experts de l'OCDE abordent cette question avec la rigueur qu'on leur connaît. Leurs recommendations sous le titre "Boîtes à bébés" proposent des solutions de bon sens pour un rangement optimisé. Lire la suite.

Marie Kondo vous a appris à ranger vos armoires et vos garages. Mais vos enfants, vous les rangez comment ?

Bitcoin

After more than ten years of Blockchain and Bitcoin, it has become clear that only a tiny minority of Bitcoin users have been able to make a fortune.

To provide a level playing field for all and fight inequality, OECD researchers have bundled their extensive research in digital currencies and pyramid schemes and transformed it into a list of easy-to-follow steps that will allow anyone to finally profit from this solution in search of a problem.

Fish Dictionary

Thanks to the Internet and social media, people all over the world have been able to better communicate with each other and learn about other cultures. Sadly, one group has been continuously been ignored so far: Fish. There is nothing on the market today that takes into account the huge community of fish.

OECD has recognized this glaring lack and provides a solution at long last: the OECD Multilingual Fish Dictionary, including for the first time the Blubb dialect used by more than 80% of the fish population.  The 2,500-‘word’ vocabulary is made up by 79.5% terms describing the concept ‘water’, while the other 20.5% express ‘polluted’ or ‘don’t swim there’.  Get your copy here and start ‘blubbing’!

Internet and social media let people all over the world  communicate with each other, with one exception: Fish. #OECD is now publishing the Multilingual Fish Dictionary, covering 2500 words of the 'Blubb' dialect (80% describe 'water' in some form). https://jfix.github.io/040119/

Chemical guidelines

With the legalisation of drugs like Cannabis making inroads all over the world, it becomes more and more difficult for the recreational user to know which place has the best Mexican Sativa, or where to find that Premium Skunk.

In a first attempt to provide evidence-based answers, OECD undertook a painstaking research effort to create an inventory of all Canadian dispensaries, listing for each the strains offered, average prices, whether on-site consumption is possible, what payment options are available etc.

An ad-hoc research group of volunteer analysts at OECD is now looking (anxiously) for the next country to legalise Cannabis.  Chemical Testing Guidelines #401 for Canada is available now.

Recent legalisation of Cannabis in Canada led #OECD to publish in-depth, up-to-date and evidence-based research  that lists all dispensaries with prices, available strains, payment, etc. Chemical Testing Guidelines #401 for Canada is available now.  https://jfix.github.io/040119/

Tax optimisation

In an unexpected reversal of positions, OECD has decided to publish an explosive new report detailing the necessary steps to ‘optimise’ taxes for individuals. While previously known to combat so-called ‘BEPS’ techniques, the Organisation has changed strategies, publishing the well-kept trade secrets of those in-the-know, making them accessible to the general public for the first time. Says Deputy Director Hugh R. Vun, “it’s all about providing a level playing field for all participants”. A copy of the report can be obtained here.
