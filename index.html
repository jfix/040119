                                                will often sleep in the welcome box provided by the government and which, once
                                                emptied, doubles as crib. This has, since it was introduced in the 1930s, reduced
                                                child mortality in Finland dramatically. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22751415" target="_blank">Read the whole story</a>.

                                                If there is one subject the OECD has been particularly known for in the recent past, 
                                                it's our efforts to combat tax avoidance in general and by multinationals 
                                                in particular, through measures that make this murky area more transparent. 
                                                The incredibly sexy overall name for these tax avoidance techniques is known 
                                                as "Base erosion and profit shifting" (BEPS).  Some of the schemes have funny 
                                                names that ressemble "Double Sandwich", "Single Malt" or "Yellow T-Shirt" but behind them 
                                                hide complex set-ups to avoid taxation, usually on a huge scale. The tax money lost this way
                                                can therefore no longer be used by governments to improve hospital care, repair roads
                                                or hire more teachers.

                                                The Blockchain and one of its applications, the crypto currency Bitcoin may have been invented
                                                some ten years ago but still so far nobody really knows what's hype and what's right. The OECD
                                                is in the right place, with its expertise, to carry out this important and much-needed research
                                                to help people and governments around the globe to make the best of this technology and avoid 
                                                its pitfalls.

                                                These guidelines have been recognized by governments and test laboratories worldwide and allow
